Question:
 String a = "World";
        String b = "World";
        System.out.println("a == b --> true");
        String c = new String("World");
        System.out.println("a == c --> " + (a == c));

Answer:
 Strings a and b are created inside the string pool area of the heap memory and point to the same memory location,
 therefore the equality operator evaluates to true.
 However, the string c is created in the non-string pool area of the heap memory and hence Strings a and c point to
 different memory locations, therefore the equality operator evaluates to false.
